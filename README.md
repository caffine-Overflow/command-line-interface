# Command Line Interface Projects 🚀

This repository contains my learning journey and practice projects while understanding how Command Line Interfaces (CLI) work using Node.js.

## 📌 What I Learned

- What a Command Line Interface (CLI) is
- How we interact with computers using commands
- How commands travel from terminal → operating system → program execution
- Difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution
- How async/await improves performance
- How to build professional CLI tools using Commander.js

---

## 🛠 Projects in This Repository

### 1️⃣ Simple CLI (Console Based)
- Created a basic CLI program
- Understood how Node.js reads command line arguments
- Practiced console-based input/output

---

### 2️⃣ CLI Word Counter (Sync Version)
- Built a CLI tool to count words in a file
- Used **synchronous file system methods**
- Learned how blocking operations work

Features:
- Accepts file path
- Counts number of words
- Displays result in terminal

---

### 3️⃣ CLI Word Counter (Commander Version)
- Improved the CLI using **Commander.js**
- Learned how to structure commands professionally

Features:
- Better command structure
- Help menu
- Cleaner argument handling

---

### 4️⃣ CLI Todo App (Async Version)
- Built a Todo CLI using **async/await**
- Learned how non-blocking operations work
- Practiced file handling asynchronously

Features:
- Add todos
- List todos
- Delete todos
- Async file operations

---

## 📚 Key Concepts Practiced

- Node.js CLI development
- File System Module (fs)
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous execution
- Async/Await
- Commander.js
- Git & GitHub workflow
- SSH authentication
